Notes for claude:

There were many things done to get mailsvc operational on an Debian 12 host. I am using a proxmox server to spin up and test.
This is a summary of the issues found, as well as changes to the code.  It I had an IDE and Git repo you could use then I would do so.
Please review the code for changes and omissions.  I may have missed something.

after you address the following features, then I will try again

add surry php repostiry into the apt packages list for debian for the php.  
 
685  wget https://packages.sury.org/php/apt.gpg -O /usr/share/keyrings/deb.sury.org-php.gpg
686  echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/deb.sury.org-php.gpg] https://packages.sury.org/php/ $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/php-sury.list

modify the dovecot user:  usermod -a -G dovecot www-data
to allow postfixadmin to generate passwords.  

note the remove of the bind to port 11332 in rspam_worker.conf.j2

Please review for omissions and veracity the changes to the postfix main and master configuration files.

To create the database and first user for postfixadmin 

  378  sudo -u www-data php /usr/share/postfixadmin/public/upgrade.php
  379  postfixadmin-cli admin add

where we create the admin user with a generated password (please include that in the local mailsvc_passwords file )
